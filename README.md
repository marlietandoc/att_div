# Analysis code for:
## [Tandoc et al. (2022) Dividing attention hurts learning in adults but not children](10.31234/osf.io/aqw28)

 This repo contains my analysis code in R : data cleaning, wrangling, analysis, and statistical models. It also contains some code samples used to generate graphs. 
 
This is currently in progress. Final versions of the analysis code as well as the full dataset will be made available upon publication (currently under review).
