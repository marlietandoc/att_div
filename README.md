# Analysis code for:
## [Tandoc et al. (2022) Dividing attention hurts learning in adults but not children](10.31234/osf.io/aqw28)

 This repo contains my analysis code (lantern_code_sample.Rmd): including all data cleaning and wrangling (tidyverse) and statistical analyses reported in the paper (including linear mixed models). It also contains some code samples used to generate graphs which can be viewed in the associated .html file
 
This space is currently in progress. Final versions of the analysis code as well as the full dataset will be made available upon publication (currently under review).
